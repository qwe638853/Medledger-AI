# Healthcare Records Management System on Hyperledger Fabric

A decentralized healthcare records management system built on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology, providing secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving medical data management with AI-powered health analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project consists of four main components:

- **Hyperledger Fabric Network**: Blockchain infrastructure with peers, orderers, and CouchDB
- **Smart Contracts (Chaincode)**: Go-based chaincode for health record management
- **Backend Services**: Python gRPC server with AI-powered health analysis using LangChain and Ollama
- **Frontend Application**: Vue.js + Vuetify web interface

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure Health Record Storage**: Store medical records on blockchain with cryptographic hashing
- **Access Control**: Patient-controlled access authorization system
- **Privacy Protection**: Patient identity protection through hash-based anonymization  
- **Multi-role Support**: Support for patients, clinics, and healthcare providers
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable transaction history for compliance and transparency
- **Access Request Management**: Workflow for requesting and approving access to medical records
- **AI Health Analysis**: Intelligent health report analysis for both users and insurers
- **Multi-language Support**: Traditional Chinese language support with medical terminology translation
- **Risk Assessment**: AI-powered disease risk evaluation and personalized recommendations
- **Insurance Integration**: Automated policy recommendations based on health metrics

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
- Go (v1.19+ for chaincode development)
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- Ollama with Llama3 model (for AI analysis)
- Hyperledger Fabric binaries and Docker images

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup


###  Start Hyperledger Fabric Network

Navigate to the hyperledger directory and start the network:

```bash
cd hyperledger
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- Certificate Authorities (Root CA, TLS CA)
- Peer nodes (peer1-org1, peer2-org1)
- Orderer service (orderer1-org1)
- CouchDB instances for state database

###  Deploy Smart Contracts

Deploy the health records chaincode:

```bash
# Install and instantiate chaincode (specific commands depend on your deployment scripts)
# Refer to your chaincode deployment scripts in hyperledger/sdk_server or similar
```

###  Setup AI Backend Services

#### Install Python Dependencies
```bash
cd backend/health_check_project
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create requirements.txt with necessary packages
```

#### Install Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
pip install langchain langchain-chroma langchain-huggingface langchain-ollama
pip install chromadb
pip install protobuf
```

#### Setup Ollama (for AI Analysis)
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull Llama3 model
ollama pull llama3:8b

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve
```

#### Setup ChromaDB Vector Database
```bash
cd backend/health_check_project
python create_collection.py
python add_data.py
```

#### Start Backend gRPC Server
```bash
cd backend/health_check_project
python test.py
```

The backend server will start on `localhost:50051`

###  Start Frontend Application

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).
